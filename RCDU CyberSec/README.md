- The matrix is organized into columns and rows. The columns represent tactics, and the rows represent techniques.

- **[MITRE ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/)** :  is a web-based tool for analyzing and understanding adversary behavior through the lens of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

- **Threat Modeling** : is a structured approach to identifying and evaluating the potential threats to a system, and the possible ways those threats can be realized.


### What Is MITRE Engenuity?

- In collaboration with private companies, MITRE Engenuity is an organization that addresses public interest challenges in cybersecurity, infrastructure resilience, healthcare effectiveness and next-generation communications.
