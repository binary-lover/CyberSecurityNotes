###

- **Hybrid Cloud**
    - AWS constitutes a bridge between your on-premise environment and AWS.
    - Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud

###

- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
    - In Amazon Web Services (AWS), **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) is a web service that enables you to securely control access to AWS resources for your users. IAM allows you to manage users, groups, roles, and their corresponding level of permissions, ensuring that only authorized individuals or systems have access to specific AWS resources. This enhances the security of your cloud environment.

###

- **Hybrid Clouds**
    - A computing environment that combines elements of both private and public clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
    - In a hybrid cloud setup, some resources are managed in-house, within an organization's private cloud infrastructure, while others are hosted externally in a public cloud.

###

- **API**

###

- **ARPANET**
    - The U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first public packet-switched computer network.

###

- **Subnet**
    - A subnet is a defined set of network IP addresses that are used to increase the security of the network and efficiency of network communication.
    - Example: 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.0.0/16
    - It has two parts:
        - **Public subnet:**
            - Apps or services available for the public
        - **Private subnet:**
            - Things which are meant to be private

###

    - Network Access Control List (NACL), a virtual firewall that protects the subnet.

###

- **CISC & RISC**
    - CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) and RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) are two types of CPU design.
    - **Here are some differences:**
        - **CISC** uses a large set of complex machine language instructions, while **RISC** uses a reduced set of simpler instructions.
        - **Instructions:** RISC uses simple instructions that take one cycle, while CISC uses complex instructions that take multiple cycles.
        - **Focus:** RISC focuses on software, while CISC focuses on hardware.
        - **Instruction format:** RISC has a fixed instruction format, while CISC has a variable instruction format.
        - **Addressing modes:** RISC has fewer addressing modes, while CISC has a variety of different instructions that can be used for complex operations.
        - **Pipeline:** RISC uses simple pipelines, while CISC uses difficult pipelines.

        - Example: KVM (Kernel-based virtual machine)
    - Type 2: Installed over a host OS
        - Example: VMware (closed source), Virtual Box (open source)

###

- **Virtual Machine:**
    - A virtual machine (VM) is a digital version of a physical computer. It's a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. VMs can be implemented using specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two.
    - Examples of VMs include:
        - VMware Workstation
        - Oracle VirtualBox
        - Oracle Secure Global Desktop

###

- **oVirt:**
    - oVirt is a free, open-source virtualization management platform. It was founded by Red Hat as a community project on which Red Hat Virtualization is based, for managing virtual machines.

###

- **Plugin:**
    - A plugin is a software component that adds specific functionality to an existing computer program or web browser.
    - Plugins are designed to extend the capabilities of the host application without requiring any changes to its core code.
    - Examples: Adobe Flash Player, Java VM, QuickTheme, etc.

###
